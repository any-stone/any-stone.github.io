# 🌿 Annie's Digital Garden

> "I am teaching my computer to do what I want."

Welcome to the source code of my personal website and digital portfolio. This is where I document my journey from HR to software engineering, my experiments with C++, and my life as a Tech Witch in Halifax.

🔗 **Live Site:** [any-stone.github.io](https://any-stone.github.io)

## 🏡 About This Project
This website is built as a **Digital Garden**. Unlike a traditional blog or portfolio, it is designed to grow organically alongside my skills. It serves as:
* A portfolio for my coding projects (like [The Witch Bug](https://github.com/any-stone/witch-bug)).
* A development log (`Dev Log`) for daily learnings and failures.
* A central hub for my professional links.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
I believe in keeping things simple unless required otherwise.
* **HTML5:** Semantic structure.
* **CSS3:** Flexbox for layout, custom styling for that "clean code" aesthetic.
* **Hosting:** GitHub Pages.
* **Philosophy:** Hand-crafted code, no heavy site builders.
