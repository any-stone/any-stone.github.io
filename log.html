            <strong>The Geometric Bunny</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            The textbook assignment was to draw a holiday scene using only the basic SSDL tools we know so far (circles, rectangles, lines). I decided to engineer a cute, "lofi aesthetic" bunny instead. 🐰
        </p>

        <p>
            <img src="bunny.png" alt="A geometric cute bunny in lofi colors" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; border-radius: 8px;">
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>The Challenge:</strong> How do you draw cute features when you only have stiff, upright geometric shapes? You have to get a bit creative with layering.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>The Ears:</strong> A rectangle for the base + a circle on top to round it off. 
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>The Smile Hack:</strong> This is my favorite part. I couldn't draw a curved "smile arc". So, I drew a full circle for the mouth... and then drew a rectangle of the <em>fur color</em> right over the top half to hide it. Is this bunny smiling or screaming? I guess you'll never know now.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            It felt less like drawing and more like solving a puzzle with limited pieces. Sometimes the best way to draw something is to draw <em>over</em> it.

            <strong>The Drunk Cube & The Lie of Graph Paper.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            Well... I always knew that computers give you exactly what you ask for, not what you <em>meant</em>. BUT. Today it literally gave me a new perspective.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>The Task was:</strong> Draw a simple 3D wireframe cube. 
                I sketched it on my iPad first, counted the grid cells, and transferred the coordinates to C++ perfectly.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>The Glitch:</strong> The code worked, but the cube looked "drunk" and distorted. The top face was huge and steep. 
                I couldn't understand why - the numbers were identical to my drawing!
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>The Epiphany:</strong> Turns out, when we draw by hand, our brain "autocorrects" bad perspective. 
                I drew a depth of "2 cells up, 1 cell right" (~63° angle), which looks fine on paper because lines have thickness and imperfection.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>The Fix:</strong> On a pixel-perfect screen, the angle looks too "steep" for the human eye, and breaks the illusion. 
                I had to switch to the <strong>"45-Degree Rule"</strong> - which I didn't know existed - moving X and Y by equal amounts. 
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <em>Lesson:</em> To make things look "real" on the screen, you have to code them "flatter" than you draw them.
            <br><br>
            Fun fact that made me jump - this is exactly the core principle of <strong>Isometric Graphics</strong> in classic games (like <em>Fallout</em> or <em>Diablo</em>). 
            They use a locked angle (often a 2:1 pixel ratio) to trick the brain into seeing 3D depth on a 2D screen. I basically stumbled upon this mechanic by accident!

            <strong>Terminal Sorcery & The Cup.</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Level Up:</strong> Installed GitHub CLI (<code>gh</code>) via Homebrew. 
                Fought with an <code>HTTP 401: Bad credentials</code> error and won by re-authenticating directly from the terminal.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Workflow Upgrade:</strong> Created the <a href="https://github.com/any-stone/ssdl-cup">ssdl-cup</a> repository 
                completely from the command line using <code>gh repo create</code>. 
                No browser clicks anymore. Felt like a true Tech Witch. 🧙‍♀️
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>The Code:</strong> The Cup project is now live! It demonstrates coordinate mapping 
                and basic shape rendering in C++.
            </li>
        </ul>

            <strong>Housekeeping & Design Day.</strong> 
            Today wasn't about writing C++ code, but about creating a proper home for it.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Git Surgery:</strong> Realized I was about to push copyrighted textbooks to GitHub. 
                Performed an emergency <code>rm -rf .git</code> and restructured the repository. 
                The bug project now lives in its own clean repo: <a href="https://github.com/any-stone/witch-bug">witch-bug</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Website Glow-up:</strong> Upgraded this Digital Garden from a plain text file to a real site with navigation and Flexbox styling. 
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>The Cup Plan:</strong> Started exercises for Chapter 1. Since SSDL doesn't support complex shapes easily, I designed a coffee cup on graph paper. 
                Plan to use the "Painter's Algorithm" (layering shapes) to create a handle using just a circle and a rectangle.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>Fixed the "Eboo" bug! I used a <code>for</code> loop to erase the forehead pixels so the hat sits properly. It felt like real engineering. Also fought with Git tokens and won.</p>
